# OptimalFloorPlanLayout_QUBO-Ising

 Using BQM (Binary Quadratic Model) to solve the relationships between Architectural Zoning Plan

  In this example we will learn how to build Architectural Floor Plan Solver using BQM (Binary Quadratic Model) as showcase for using Classical DIMOD BQM Solver (SimulatedAnnealingSampler) compared to Dynex QUBO/Ising Solver.

 NOTE: this example is just for educational purposes and it cannot be used as standalone application due to insufficient parameters/constrains that need to be added.
